**Instant Answers are an opportunity for anyone to create their own results. **

Instant Answers appear on DuckDuckGo.com above ads and organic links, which serves [millions of searches](https://duckduckgo.com/traffic.html) every day. Instant Answers are created by an open source community of developers [around the world](http://duckduckgo.meetup.com/). Welcome to our community!

## Improve a Live Instant Answer

We welcome new contributors to dive in and improve live Instant Answers. It's a great, hands-on way to learn how things work. Start by [setting up your development environment](http://docs.duckduckhack.com/welcome/setup-dev-environment.html).

Have a [favorite Instant Answer](http://duck.co/ia) that you want to make even better? Feel free to dive in.

We also make sure to identify "low-hanging fruit" for new community members to work on.

- [Goodie Low Hanging Fruit](https://github.com/duckduckgo/zeroclickinfo-goodies/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22Low-Hanging+Fruit%22) (Instant Answers that **do not** make external calls)
- [Spice Low Hanging Fruit](https://github.com/duckduckgo/zeroclickinfo-spice/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22Low-Hanging+Fruit%22) (Instant Answers that call external APIs)
