# Welcome to DuckDuckHack

**Instant Answers use the Web's best data to solve searches in few or zero clicks. With your knowledge of the Web and a little bit of coding, DuckDuckGo can show the best possible result for the topics you care about most!**

[Instant Answers](https://duck.co/ia) are created and maintained by a community of open source developers around the world so that millions of searches on DuckDuckGo (like [who's in space?](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=who%27s+in+space%3F&ia=answer) and [tennis help](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=tennis+help&ia=cheatsheet&iax=1)) show a perfect result, above any ads or regular links. Just like the Wikipedia community creates articles for topics -- the DuckDuckHack community creates Instant Answers for searches!

1. Use these docs and our help to improve search results for the topics you care about.
2. Join our [community channels](http://docs.duckduckhack.com/resources/get-in-touch.html) to keep in touch with all the latest news and DuckDuckHack events.
3. Become a leader and all-star contributor helping to change the world of search through community!

Instant Answers allow you to create your own search results. Here are some examples of what contributors have created. You can see [all live Instant Answers listed here](https://duck.co/ia).

Instant Answers can be quite dynamic...
