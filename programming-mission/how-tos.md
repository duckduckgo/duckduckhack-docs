A pull request is ready to be merged when it meets the following requirements:

2. All the tests pass (e.g. coverage test for Fatheads, backend tests...)
3. It's live on beta, has been manually tested very throughly by staff members or Language Leaders and it looks good
4. It's an improvement compared to what we have live on [duckduckgo.com](https://duckduckgo.com)
