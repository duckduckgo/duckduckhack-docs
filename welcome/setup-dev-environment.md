# Setting Up Your Development Environment

In order to get moving with Instant Answer development, you'll need to setup your environment. There are three main steps:

1. Fork the appropriate repository on Github.com
2. Set Up the DuckDuckGo environment on Codio.com
3. Clone your Github fork onto the Codio environment

We've broken these down step-by-step below. If you prefer, you can also watch a [video screencast of this tutorial](https://vimeo.com/147292974).

## 1. Fork the appropriate repository on Github.com

### 1a. Sign Up for Github.com

> Already have a GitHub Account? Perfect, move to the next step.

Git is a tool that allows many people to collaborate on one codebase. GitHub is a popular site for groups to host Git repositories. If this is your first time using Git and GitHub, we've created an [overview of how you'll use Git](http://docs.duckduckhack.com/resources/git-workflow.html) to contribute to DuckDuckHack.

To get started, let's sign up for GitHub:

1. Go to https://github.com/join and enter the required information, then click "**Create an Account**"
2. Click "**Finish Signup**" to continue with a **Free** GitHub account.

### 1b. Create a Fork

Let's obtain the latest copy of the open-source code powering all Instant Answers. We're going to "fork" that code, so you'll have your own personal copy which you can modify and test without affecting the original.

The two most common repositories are [Goodies](https://github.com/duckduckgo/zeroclickinfo-goodies) and [Spice](https://github.com/duckduckgo/zeroclickinfo-spice). If you're not sure what type to pick, [here's a guide on the differences](http://docs.duckduckhack.com/welcome/determining-ia-type.html).

1. Make sure you are logged in to Github.com as yourself

2. Go to the corresponding Instant Answer repository homepage:
    - [Spice](https://github.com/duckduckgo/zeroclickinfo-spice) (for Instant Answers that will make external API calls)
    - [Goodies](https://github.com/duckduckgo/zeroclickinfo-goodies) (for Cheat Sheets, and Instant Answers that don't make external API calls)
    - [Fathead](https://github.com/duckduckgo/zeroclickinfo-fathead) (for Instant Answers that use a key-value store)
    - [Longtail](https://github.com/duckduckgo/zeroclickinfo-longtail) (for Instant Answers that will perform full-text search)


3. Click "**Fork**", near the top-right corner.

	Wait while the repo forks...

4. You should see a page that looks nearly identical to the repo home page you were just on. The URL should be different though, it should look like **`https://github.com/yourGitHubUsername/zeroclickinfo-xxxxx`**.

	**This is the URL for your personal fork of the DuckDuckHack code. Keep it handy, we'll be using it in a minute!**

----

## 2. Set Up the DuckDuckGo Environment on Codio.com

Before we work on the Instant Answer codebase, we first need a development machine that can *run and test* these files. We'll use [Codio](http://www.codio.com) to set this up super quickly and conveniently.

> Codio is the best and most popular option among contributors. If you need to develop locally, we have [alternate development environments](http://docs.duckduckhack.com/resources/other-dev-environments.html) available.

### 2a. Sign Up for a Codio Account

**Important note - use of Codio is 100% free for DuckDuckHack contributors.** There is no need to worry about free trial periods (see Step 2b below).

> Already have a Codio Account? Perfect, move on to the next step.

1. Go to [Signup link](https://codio.com/p/signup?orgToken=Ax-OB3tU4sdNAG8axJBYcjNqR04).
3. Click the green "**GitHub**" icon.
4. If you aren't already signed into GitHub, enter your GitHub login details and then click "**Sign In**".
5. Click "**Authorize application**" to continue.
6. In the new screen, enter the required details and click "**Create Account**".

### 2b. Join the DuckDuckGo Organization on Codio

> This step ensures you do not have to pay for Codio and are not limited by any trial periods.

1. **After logging into Codio,** [click this link](https://codio.com/p/login?orgToken=Ax-OB3tU4sdNAG8axJBYcjNqR04) and you'll be added to our organization, which gives you a professional Codio setup free of charge.

2. You should see a confirmation message at the bottom of your Codio screen after clicking.

### 2c. Create a Copy of the DuckDuckGo Environment

In this step we'll setup our virtual development computer with all the convenient development tools pre-installed. We've already created this for you on Codio, and all you need to do is make a copy for yourself.

1. Go to https://codio.com/duckduckgo/duckduckhack and click "**Project**" at the top left corner.

2. In the drop-down, select the "**Fork**" option.

    ![Codio Fork](http://docs.duckduckhack.com/assets/codio_fork.png)

3. In the pop-up window, select the "**Box & Project**" option and click "**Continue**".

    ![Codio Fork Both](http://docs.duckduckhack.com/assets/codio_fork_both.png)

4. Wait a minute while the environment copies...

5. You should now see a new window with three panes. It should say "**DuckDuckHack**" at the top of the left pane.

Good work! You now have your own machine on Codio with all the DuckDuckHack development tools installed. You'll learn more about these tools in the tutorials.

## 3. Clone Your Github Fork onto the Codio Environment

Now we'll put it all together - we'll bring the code we forked on Github onto the environment we set up. This is called [cloning](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/) a repository.

### 3a. Load Your Codio Environment

> If you're already in Codio from the previous section - excellent! Skip to the next step.

1. Go to the [Codio projects page](https://codio.com/home/projects).

	> See a "**Sign In**" screen? Use the "**Sign in via GitHub**" method like you did before (see Step #2 [here](#sign-up-for-a-codio-account)).

2. Click the "**DuckDuckHack**" project.

3. You should now see the three-pane window we previously saw.

	> Tip: Press *Ctrl+Alt+R* (*Cmd+Alt+R* on a Mac), this will improve the layout a bit. (You can also click *View->Layouts->Default* from the command bar at the top).

### 3b. Clone the Code

1. Open the Terminal. You can do this by clicking *Tools->Terminal* from the menu, or pressing *Shift+Alt+T*. You should see the right side pane change into a black command prompt.

2. Type **`git clone <Your GitHub URL Here>.git`** into the Terminal, replacing `<Your GitHub URL Here>` accordingly. It should look something like this for a Goodie:

    ```
    [codio@buffalo-pixel workspace]$ git clone https://github.com/githubusername/zeroclickinfo-goodies.git
    ```

	Enter your Github credentials as prompted.

    _**If your Github password doesn't work**, you may need to enter a [Personal Access Token](https://github.com/settings/tokens) as your password instead. Simply copy and paste your token from your [Github Settings](https://github.com/settings/tokens) when prompted for your password. (This happens if you have set up [Github's Two-Factor Authentication](https://github.com/blog/1614-two-factor-authentication) feature.)_

3. Press "**Enter**". You should see the Terminal print out some text that looks like this:

    ```
    [codio@buffalo-pixel workspace]$ git clone https://github.com/githubusername/zeroclickinfo-goodies.git
    Cloning into 'zeroclickinfo-goodies'...
    remote: Counting objects: 18623, done.
    remote: Compressing objects: 100% (8083/8083), done.
    remote: Total 18623 (delta 8084), reused 18179 (delta 7868)
    Receiving objects: 100% (18623/18623), 5.50 MiB | 9.51 MiB/s, done.
    Resolving deltas: 100% (8084/8084), done.
    Checking connectivity... done.
    ```

4. The file tree on the left side of Codio should update. You'll see a new "**zeroclickinfo-xxxxx**" directory (where "**xxxxx**" is whichever Instant Answer type you chose)

5. Change into the current directory of the terminal by typing **`cd zeroclickinfo-xxxxx`**, where "**xxxxx**" is whichever Instant Answer type you chose.

6. To start working on a new change, create a new branch in your repository for this particular project. Make sure to work on [a separate branch](http://docs.duckduckhack.com/resources/git-workflow.html) for each contribution.

	> Create a new branch by typing  **`git checkout -b branch_name`**. You can use any branch name you like. You can switch between branches by using **`git checkout branch_name`**.
